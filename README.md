# Task-2 : Data Visualization and Storytelling

Dashboard Summary: Superstore Sales Analysis

Visual Elements Used:

Clustered Bar Chart - Sum of Sales by Segment and Region
: Shows how sales are distributed across different customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) and across regions (Central, East, South, West).

Donut Chart - Sum of Sales by Segment
: Highlights the overall share of each segment in total sales. "Consumer" is the largest segment, followed by "Corporate" and "Home Office".

Treemap Chart - Sum of Sales by Category and Sub-Category
: Breaks down sales by broader product categories (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology) and further into sub-categories like Phones, Tables, Binders, etc.

Line Chart - Sum of Sales by Sub-Category
: Visualizes which sub-categories drive the most revenue. “Chairs” and “Phones” top the list, while items like “Labels” and “Fasteners” contribute very little.

Storytelling & Business Insights:

1️.Customer Segment Focus
The Consumer segment generates nearly 47% of total sales, making it the primary revenue driver.
Despite having lower overall sales, Home Office has a notable share in certain regions like the West — a potential area for targeted promotions.

2.Regional Strategy
West and East regions show consistently higher sales across all segments.
South lags behind — suggesting room for market expansion or improvement in customer targeting.

3.Product-Level Insights
Phones and Chairs are top-selling sub-categories, particularly in Technology and Furniture respectively.
Some sub-categories like Tables and Bookcases in Furniture, though prominent, may need profit analysis due to high cost or return issues.

4.Category Performance
Technology dominates with high-value items like Phones and Machines.
Office Supplies shows wide product variety but lower revenue per item, pointing toward bulk sales or low-margin offerings.
